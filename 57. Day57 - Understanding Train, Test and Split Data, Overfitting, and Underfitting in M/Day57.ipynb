    "## What is train_test_split in Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "In Scikit-learn, train_test split is a function used to create training and testing data to be usert to measure a machine learning model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Use Train Test Split in Machine Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "In machine leaming, we often build or train models on a single dataset To evaluate if a machine learning model is doing as expected, we need to train the model on one portion of the dataset, and compare how accurately the predictions map to the real-world data\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate the accuracy of machine learning models, data scientists need to split datasets in two portions called\n",

    "-testing set (test the model)\n",
    "## How to Use Train Test Split\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Split a dataset into a training and testing set\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Provide the testing size with the test_size parameter\n",

    "4. Make predictions on the training set\n",
